# About Me:

Hello, I'm data scientist with a love for statistics and programming. My primary skillset lies in data wrangling using Pandas and Natural Language Processing related work. My main language is Python, however I also do a lot of hobbiest work in R and I'm sure over the course of my career I'll be learning all sorts of weird tools. 

# Current Projects

## Fire Emblem Dashboard

Fire Emblem is a video game franchise with a long history and a whole lot of data. It's a wonderful mix of probability and strategy and, as such, is the perfect place to build a tool with my background. With this project my goal is to create a verstile dashboard giving users access to all of the data they may need at a moments notice and the ability to extract new insights about these games many of us love.
